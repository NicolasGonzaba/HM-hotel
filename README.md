// Peer review: Nicolas Gonzaba- For minor issues the box the wheel of luxury is in at the top is a little small compared to the template, the room names aren't meant to be bold, and the amenities icons are squished. Additionally you can set and end date before a start date in the reserve a room and you can have a negitive amount guests but i doubt you'll get marked down for those seeing as the weren't in the template. as for bigger issues the navbar buttons are supposed to have borders as you mouse over them, beach side suite card is bigger than the others at smaller sizes, and the packages section is confusingly formatted at smaller sizes with certan images being above the package while others have it below. it might be better to just delete the images as you get to smaller breakpoint to make it less confusing. Also the open ended inputs are bigger then the date inputs at smaller breakpoints.
